# Brain_Tumor_Detection_Using_SVM

This code provides the Matlab implementation that detects the brain tumor region and also classify the tumor as benign and malignant.

This code is implementation for the - A. Mathew and P. Anto, "Tumor detection and classification of MRI brain image using wavelet transform and SVM", 2017 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication (ICSPC), 2017. Available: 10.1109/cspc.2017.8305810.

Dataset used to train this model is BRATS2013.
